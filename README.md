### Next Steps
1. For this project next steps would be to expand beyond a single page application to allow a user to have their own profile and books. 

2. Work on making this app accessible and inclusive using accessibility tools.

3. Incorporate a 4th model.

4. Create rspec files to test this fullstack app.

5. Add more additional validation for adding a new book to the collection.

6. Continue to add fullstack resources to the README.
